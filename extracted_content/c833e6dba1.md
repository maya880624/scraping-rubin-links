# lsst.ts.tcpipÂ¶

Python code to support TCP/IP communication using asyncio.

## User GuideÂ¶

The basic classes are:

  * `Client`: a TCP/IP client. One use case is CSCs that communicate via TCP/IP with low-level controllers. Providing a connect_callback makes it easy to report the connection state as an event, and also allows you to detect and handle a failed connection.

  * `OneClientReadLoopServer`: an abstract TCP/IP server that only accepts a single client connection at a time (rejecting extra attempts to connect) and runs a read loop while connected. One common use case is mock servers in CSC packages. Override the read_and_dispatch method in a subclass to use it.

  * `OneClientServer`: the concrete parent class of `OneClientReadLoopServer`; a server with no read loop. Most users will find `OneClientReadLoopServer` more convenient.

  * `BaseOneClientServerTestCase`: a base class for unit tests of servers.




A simple example of using `Client` and `OneClientReadLoopServer` together is provided in tests/test_example.py. This example is written as a unit test in order to avoid bit rot.

The server classes are designed so to be inherited from, in order to add application-specific behavior. An example of inheriting from `OneClientReadLoopServer` is `MockDomeController` in ts_atdome. One can also inherit from `Client`; see `CommandTelemetryClient` in ts_hexrotcomm for an example.

### Strings and JSONÂ¶

In the Python standard TCP/IP library, all reading and writing is done using `bytes`. To write a `str` you must encode it to `bytes` and, usually, append a terminator, then write the resulting bytes. To read a `str` you usually readuntil a terminator, decode the read `bytes` to a str and, usually, strip the terminator.

However, `Client` and the server classes offer convenience methods to do this for you, as well as methods to read and write json-encoded data (via the common base class `BaseClientOrServer`):

  * `BaseClientOrServer.read_str`

  * `BaseClientOrServer.write_str`

  * `BaseClientOrServer.read_json`

  * `BaseClientOrServer.read_json`




The `encoding` and `terminator` constructor arguments allow you specify the desired encoding and terminator for these methods. The default encoding and terminator will work in many cases.

### Binary StructsÂ¶

To read and write a binary struct, define a `ctypes.Structure` and use `BaseClientOrServer.read_into` and `BaseClientOrServer.write_from`. For example (where `client_or_server` is an instance of `Client` or `OneClientServer`):
    
    
    import ctypes
    
    class TrivialStruct(ctypes.Structure):
        _fields_ = [
            ("a_double", ctypes.c_double),
            ("three_ints", ctypes.c_int64 * 3),
        ]
    
    # Reading
    data = TrivialStruct()
    try:
        await client_or_server.read_into(data)
    except (asyncio.IncompleteReadError, ConnectionError):
        # Connection is closed
        ...handle the closed connection
    
    # Writing
    data = TrivialStruct(a_double=1.2e3, three_ints=(-1, 2, 3))
    await client_or_server.write_from(data)
    

### Details of using `asyncio.StreamReader` and `asyncio.StreamWriter`Â¶

The asyncio documentation is good, but I found a few things surprising. `Client` and `OneClientServer` are designed to hide some of these details, but this information may still be helpful.

In the examples below `reader` is an `asyncio.StreamReader` and `writer` is an `asyncio.StreamWriter`.

  * When you write data, be sure to call drain, else the data may not actually be written:
    
        writer.write(data_bytes)
    await writer.drain()
    

  * When you read data, check for a closed connection by catching `(asyncio.IncompleteReadError, ConnectionError)`. For example:
    
        try:
        data = reader.readuntil(tcpip.DEFAULT_TERMINATOR) # or reader.read or reader.readline
        # If data is empty then the connection is closed and reader.at_eof() will be True.
        # If there was unread data on the reader, then a partial result will be returned.
        # reader.at_eof() will be true if the result is partial.
    
        # There are other read methods that handle EOF differently.
        # reader.readexactly and tcpip.read_into raise asyncio.IncompleteReadError
        # if the connection is closed before enough data is available.
    except (asyncio.IncompleteReadError, ConnectionError):
        # Connection is closed.
        # Do something to tell your application not to write any more data,
        # such as cancelling the write loop...
    
        # Close the writer
        await lsst.ts.tcpip.close_stream_writer(writer)
    
        # Deal with lack of data, e.g. by raising an exception,
        # or returning None, or...
    

A few read methods do not raise `asyncio.IncompleteReadError`. See `asyncio.StreamReader` documentation for details.

  * You can only reliably detect a closed connection in the stream reader; writing to stream writer after the other end has disconnected does not raise an exception.

  * When a reader is closed, `reader.at_eof()` is not false right away. It will go false if you try to read data, or if you simply wait long enough.

  * When you are done with a TCP/IP stream, close the stream writer (you cannot close a stream reader). To close a stream writer, call `close_stream_writer`:
    
        from lsst.ts import tcpip
    
    await tcpip.close_stream_writer(writer)
    

This convenience function calls `asyncio.StreamWriter.close` and `asyncio.StreamWriter.wait_closed`. It also catches and ignores `ConnectionError`, which is raised if the writer is already closed.

Warning: `asyncio.StreamWriter.wait_closed` may raise `asyncio.CancelledError` if the writer is being closed. `close_stream_writer` does not catch and ignore that exception, because I felt that was too risky.
