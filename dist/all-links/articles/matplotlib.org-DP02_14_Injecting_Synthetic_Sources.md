Event handling#
Matplotlib supports event handling with
a GUI neutral event model, so you can connect to Matplotlib events without
knowledge of what user interface Matplotlib will ultimately be plugged in to.
This has two advantages: the code you write will be more portable, and
Matplotlib events are aware of things like data coordinate space and which
axes the event occurs in so you don't have to mess with low level
transformation details to go from canvas space to data space. Object picking
examples are also included.

Embedding Matplotlib in graphical user interfaces#
You can embed Matplotlib directly into a user interface application by
following the embedding_in_SOMEGUI.py examples here. Currently
Matplotlib supports PyQt/PySide, PyGObject, Tkinter, and wxPython.
When embedding Matplotlib in a GUI, you must use the Matplotlib API
directly rather than the pylab/pyplot procedural interface, so take a
look at the examples/api directory for some example code working with
the API.
